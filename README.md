üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Burger Site! üçî

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, Burger Site, which I‚Äôve developed using a mix of cutting-edge technologies for both the frontend and backend.

Tech Stack:
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a sleek, responsive design.
JavaScript for interactive functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience.


Backend:
ASP.NET Core MVC 6.0 ‚Äì I used the MVC architecture to ensure a clean, scalable codebase.


Generic Repository Pattern ‚Äì This design pattern improves data access and ensures reusability across the application.


Microsoft Identity ‚Äì Integrated for secure user authentication, handling login and registration processes.


Key Features:
Admin Dashboard:

Admins can manage meal options (add, edit, delete).

View and manage customer bookings.

Add, modify, or delete user data.

Security & Reliability:
Implemented both client-side and server-side validation to enhance the security and robustness of the application.


Why This Project?
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply and expand my web development skills. It allowed me to dive deeper into ASP.NET Core, design patterns like the Generic Repository, and best practices for managing user authentication.

Looking Forward:
I‚Äôm excited about continuing to grow and build more projects that challenge me to improve and adopt new technologies
