Excited to Share My New Project: Burger Site

I'm thrilled to share the completion of my new project, Burger Site. This project was developed with a strong focus on both frontend and backend technologies.

On the frontend, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. For the backend, I worked with the MVC pattern in ASP.NET Core 8.0 to ensure a clean and maintainable architecture.

One of the key features I implemented in this project is the Generic Repository pattern, which helps streamline the management of data access and improve code reusability. Additionally, I integrated Microsoft Identity to manage user authentication, including login and registration processes, ensuring a secure experience for all users.

For the admin dashboard, I developed a user-friendly interface where admins can:

Add, edit, and delete meal options
View and manage reservations
Edit, delete, or manage user data
This project was a great opportunity to enhance my skills and put into practice modern web development techniques. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation in future projects!
